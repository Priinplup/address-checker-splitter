# Address Checker + Splitter
Takes addresses as input, processes them through Google Maps API, and returns the split address. 
Addresses are split into the following rows: 
Address Line 1, Address Line 2, City, State, Zip Code

Bulk addresses are split and returned in the format of a spreadsheet. In the spreadsheet, Address Line 1 corresponds with the A column, Address Line 2 corresponds with the B column, etc.
